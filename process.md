# Iterations

Got the mesh-web network to finally work. Not sure, however, that I like it. It doesn't really tie into what I'm thinking of just yet, however, the idea of the relations being depicted rather than the objects is kind of compelling. That which does not relate to anything else may as well not exist (of course, everything that exists (I think) relates to _something_, so this isn't much of a statement)!

Next I think I really need to start defining their behavior, so that I actually have something to depict.
